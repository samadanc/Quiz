<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<h3>Due Date: Tue, Jan 15 12AM (midnight)</h3>
<p>by E. Brown, 2019</p>
<p>Propose an original/unique functional requirement for the project, validated with a use case.</p>
<p>The specification for the use case formats are described in class notes 1 and 2. The project description and the specification for the requirements are provided in the <a href="http://www.cs.mun.ca/~brown/cs2005/Notes/assignment1/assignment1.html/template4requirements.html">requirements list template</a>.</p>
<p>Your requirement will have to be a unique contribution among the class submissions, included in a shared requirements file.</p>
<p>The use case supporting verification may be your own or someone else's; but it must be in the shared repository and linked to your requirement. You are encouraged to write and add a new use case to the repository usecase folder for this purpose.</p>
<h3>Submission instructions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add your proposed requirement to the shared requirements list, which will be formatted according to the <a href="requirements/template4requirements.html">requirements list template</a> and accompanying use cases.</li>
<li>Pull the latest version of the shared requirements file from the course git repository. See the introduction to <a href="../Notes/gitsubmission.html">Git submission for COMP2005</a></li>
<li>Add your <strong>one</strong> <em>original</em> requirement to the shared requirements file and push the updated result back to the assignment 1 repository.</li>
<li>Remember if the push fails because your copy of the shared requirements file is out of date, you may try  again from step 2.</li>
<li>Make sure your push does not mangle the shared requirements file.  You are free to revise the sequence and hierarchy of requirements in the shared list, but do not delete any one else's work.  You are responsible for correcting formatting mistakes made by other students, without deleting their content.</li>
<li>NOTE: if two of the shared requirements are similar, the one with the earlier revision date will be considered original. If a dispute arises about who submitted first, the argument will be settled by examining the repository submission log.</li>
<li>Note that once it is in the git repository, your contribution will be retrieved by other students.</li>
</ol>
<p><big><strong>BE VERY CAREFUL</strong></big> you only add appropriate files to the repository. Remember, anyone can see them: they are public, not private submissions. If you are not sure what you are doing, then ask about it before proceeding!</p>
