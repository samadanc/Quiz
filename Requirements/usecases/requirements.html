  <h1>Introduction</h1>    

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The client is the instructor for COMP2005 course at the Computer
         Science        
         Department, Memorial University of Newfoundland</p>
    <p>The project description presented by the client is as follows:
        <blockquote>
        The COMP2005 course makes use of a proprietary online quiz application integrated into the 
        Brightspace product and supported by Memorial's CITL unit. However, the COMP2005 instructor
        would like to develop his own online quiz program, which could later be extended to
        include software code testing and live classroom quiz features. The initial release of
        this project may be limited to MCQ questions and online asynchronous (i.e. not live 
        classroom) quiz.
        </blockquote> </p>
    <p>Each project team is a group of up to 5 students registered in COMP2005 
        for the Winter 2019 semester. </p>
    <p>   

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Acceptable sources for requirements gathering include:
            <ul>
                <li>Client interview</li>
                <li>User group dicussion</li>
                <li>User stories</li>
                <li>UML use case analysis</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>In their first assignment, each student is tasked with producing an   
         original requirement for this project added to 
         the requirements list in this document. Functional requirements should be validated by a use case. 

       <h3>Documentation</h3>

        <h4>Requirements list HTML tags and conventions</h4>
            <p>HTML tags, attributes, and styles have been defined for the 
                Requirements List section of this document as follows: 
            <ul>
                <li>CSS styling of the requirements list is maintained in the file "requirements.css". 
                    To change the list appearance, modify the CSS file. </li> 
                <li>The <code>rqlist</code> CSS class identifies a 
                    requirements list <code>&lt;ol class="rqlist"&gt;</code> tag</li>
                <li>The <code>rqitem</code> CSS class identifies a 
                    requirements item using an <code>&lt;li class="rqitem"&gt;</code> tag</li>
                <li>If the <code>rqitem</code> is a requirements category heading:
                    <ul>
                       <li> It starts with the category title </li>
                       <li> Following the title it contains 
                       a <code>&lt;ol class="rqlist"&gt;</code> sub-list.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Otherwise the <code>rqitem</code> is a requirement:
                   <ul>    
                    <li>It has a <code>data-moscow</code>
                        attribute identifying its MOSCOW priority class 
                        <code>&lt;li class="rqitem" data-moscow=m&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>The item content starts with a short imperative title in 
                        present tense and active voice that captures the intent of the requirement. </li> 
                    <li>The item contains a fuller description paragraph element following the title. 
                        The description may also contain concerns and issues that are
                        unresolved or other commentary. The description is CSS class <code>rqdesc</code>
                        with a <code>&lt;p class=rqdesc&gt;</code> tag</li>
                    <li>A requirement data paragraph element follows the the description. 
                        This data includes the requirement author's email id and the date and time the 
                        requirement was submitted
                        This paragraph is classed <code>rqdata</code> with 
                        a <code>&lt;p class=rqdata&gt;</code> tag</li>
                    <li>A requirement validation paragraph element follows the requirement data element. 
                        This element references the methods and documents used to validate the
                        requirements.
                        Each requirement should refer to at least one use case or one user story; but may
                        have additional sources of validity.
                        Explanation of validity and links to other media files such as use case analyses 
                        should be supplied. 
                          This paragraph is classed <code>rqvali</code> with 
                          a <code>&lt;p class=rqvali&gt;</code> tag</li>
                    <li>A requirement verfication plan paragraph element follows the requirement data 
                        element. 
                        This element references the methods and documents used to validate the
                        requirements. 
                        Links to other media files such as use case analyses are encouraged. 
                        This paragraph is classed <code>rqveri</code> with 
                        a <code>&lt;p class=rqveri&gt;</code> tag</li>
                   </ul>
                </li>
